algorithm:

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions
or rules to perform a specific task or solve a 
particular problem.



how to write the algorithm:

algorithm swap(a,b)
{
  temp=a;-1
  a=b;-1
  b=temp;-1
}
f(n)=3
s(n)=3

how to analyze an algorithm:

  1.time 
  2.space
  3.n/w consumption
  4.power consumption
  5.cpu registors

algorithmic paradigms:
```````````````````````

The word paradigm means ' pattern of thought'.

Brute force

divide and conquer

greedy

dynamic programing

note:
these  paradigms define the general structure of 
how the solution would look like.


Brute Forece:

The beauty of a brute force method is that it is pretty 
straightforward and if a solution to a problem exists, 
you are guaranteed to find it. 

This option is also the most exhasustive option as we might 
go through all the possibilities before arriving at the result.


what is brute force method?

Greedy algorithm:

Greedy algorithm is a paradigm that describes the approach on how 
you can go about solving a problem.

making the choice that seems best at that point of time.


datastructure basics:

array
stack
linkedlist
queue


Array:
```````
An array is a linear data structure that is capable of holding values 
that are of a similar type.

arr = 4 8 15 16 23 42

int[] x={4,8,15,16,23,42}

x[0]
x[1]
x[2]
if the array size is n-
maximum index is n-1

int[] physics={}
int[] chemistry={}
int[] biology ={}


  int x[]={20,30,40};
    3
	2
	
x[3]=50;



Linkedlist:
````````````
Linked List is a data structure that is really helpful to write memory 
efficient and fast programs. 

A linked list consists of list nodes. 

Each list node has a value and the address to the next node. 

This chain of nodes is often called as a linked list. 


struct node{


   //this is the data type that we want ti stire
   int data;
   //a pointer to the next node, same type
   struct node*next;

}

list = list -> next

how to traversing a linked list?


stack:

push:
in this operation, we add an element on top 
of the previous element such that the new element 
is now the top element. 
similar to adding a new plate on top of the existing plates.

pop:
this is the deletion operation,

push(): add a new element
pop(): remove an element 

peek()/top(): 

isEmpty():
isFull():


100
  90
  
isFull() -> false


Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure that stores 
data (similar to linkedlists and stacks)
in a queue, the oeder in which the data arrives is important.

A queue is an ordered list in which insertions are doen at one end(rear)
and deletions are done at other end(front)

The first element that you insert, is the first one that is removed. 

Queue: First in First out(FIFO)


Insertion sort:

2,4,6,3,10,k,j


2,3,4,6,10,k,j


2,3,4,6,10,j,k

algorithm:
1.start scanning the elements from 2nd position. 
2.if(arr[i]<arr[i-1])
  1.swap arr[i] and arr[i-1]
  2.keep swapping until the number is less than the previous number.
  
3.The array gets sorted as we reach the end.

 

i=4;
key = 7
j = 4-1=3


[2,5,9,3,7,4,11,13]

2,5,3,9,7,4,11,13

2,3,5,9,7,4,11,13
2,3,5,7,9,4,11,13

/*function to sort array using insertion sort*/

void sort(int arr[])
{

   int n = arr.length; //8
   for(int i=1;i<n;++i){
     int key = arr[i];
	 int j = i-1;
	 
	 while(j>=0 && arr[j] > key){
	    arr[j+1]=arr[j];
		j=j-1;
	 }
   
   arr[j+1] = key;
   }

}

Bubble Sort:
`````````````

Bubble sort is one of the techniques which can be used 
to arrange a set of elements in a certain pre-defined 
manner. 

As the name suggests, at every iteration, the largest 
elements bubbles towards the end.


principle of swapping two elements.

algorithm:

we start from the bottom of the array 
and look for smaller elements.

select the last element

if the second last element is greater than the selected number, 
swap both of them.

Now compare the second last number with the third last number.
if the number is not small, then do not swap, else again swap.

This way by swapping each time, we will get the smallest 
number in the array and it will bubble at the top of the array

[5,6,9,4,8,2]

void bubbleSort(int arr[])
{
  int n =  arr.length;
  for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
  {
    for(int j=0;j<n-i-1;j++){
	  if(arr[j]> arr[j+1]){
	  //swap arr[j+1] and arr[j]
	  int temp= arr[j];
	  arr[j]=arr[j+1];
	  arr[j+1]=temp;
	  }
 }
 
merge sort
selection sort


linear search:

[13,0,8,15,1,6,2,7,21,3,4,9,5]

Number to search = 7,25


1.start from the first element.
2.check if it matches the target element.
3.if yes, we found the element
4.else, move ahead and check again
5.Repeat the above process till you reach the end of the array.

public static boolean linearSearch(int[] arr,int numberToSearch){

    boolean found = false;
	
	//search sequentially through each element
	
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	
	    if(arr[i] == numberToSearch){
		   found=true;
		   break;
		}
	   
	}
	
	return found;
	}
	
sorted linear search:
`````````````````````
[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,13,15,21,30,99]

6


public static boolean linearSearch(int[] arr,int numberToSearch){

    boolean found = false;
	
	//search sequentially through each element
	
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	
	    if(arr[i] == numberToSearch){
		   found=true;
		  
		   if(arr[i] > numberToSearch)
		   break;
		}
	   
	}
	
	return found;
	}
	


Binary Search:
It is one of the most important search algorithm in computer programming.

As the name suggests, binary means 2, it involes bisecting the array in 2 halves
 at every step to ultimately narrow down our search space.
 
 The only restriction is that the list should be sorted.
 


working of binary search:


numberToSearch = 12

  [1,3,4,6,7,9,10,12,13,15,16,19,20,23,24,27,2,31]
  

algorithm:

1.set the start position as begininig of array.

2.set the end position as the end of array.

3.start a loop

4.check the middle eleement. if it matches , we found our result.

5.if (middle element > number to search), update the end position to middle

6.else , update the first position 

7.Repeat steps 4-6 until we find our element, or exhaust out of options.


static boolean binarySearch(int[] arr, int numberToSearch)
{

 int left = 0;
 int right = arr.length-1;
 
 while(left < = right){
 
   //find the mid index
   int mid = (left + right) / 2
 
   //check at mid index
   if(arr[mid]==numberToSearch)
   return true;
   //update the terminal indices
   
   if(arr[mid] <numberToSearch){
      left = mid + 1;
   
   }
   else
   right= mid-1;
 
 }

  return false;

}


some factors are considered for choosing the datastructure:

what type of data needs to be stored?
cost of operations
memory usage


A tree is also one of the data structure that represent hierarchal data. 



public static void main(String[] args)
{

TreeNode root = new TreeNode(4);
root.left = new TreeNode(8);
root.right = new TreeNOde(15);

TreeNode leftNode = root.left;
TreeNode rightNode = root.right;

leftNode.left = new TreeNode(16);

rightNode.left=new TreeNode(23);
rightNOde.right = new TreeNode(42);


System.out.println(root.val);
System.out.println(root.right.left.val);

Software Development Life Cycle

It is a systematic process for planning , creating, testing, deploying 
and maintaining software.

it consists of various phases, each serving a specific purpose in the 
development process. 

1.Requirements Gathering and Analysis

2.Planning

3.Design

4.implementation (coding)

5.Testing

6.Deployment

7.Maintainence and Support


Each phase is interconnected and the SDLC provides a structured approach
to software development, helping teams manage and control 
te entire process effectively.


1.waterfall model
2.Iterative model
3.Incremental model
4.V-Model(Verification and Validation Model)
5.Spiral Model
6.Agile Model

   Agile is an iterative and incremental model that 
   emphasizes flexibility and customer feedback.
   sprint
   dev -> qa -> devops team -> db team ->

scrum



agile model / agile methodology/ agile process:


It is an iterative and incremental approach/process.


Agile principles:

1) Customer no need to wait for long time.
2) We develop,test and release piece of software to the customer with few no.of 
   features.
3) we can accept/accomodate requirement changes.

There will be good communication between  Customer,Business Analyst,Developer 
and Tester.

Advantages:

Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or we can accomodate
requirement changes in the middel of the development.

Releases will be very fast(weekly)

Customer no need to wait for long time .

Good communcation betweeen team.

It is very easy model to adopt.


Disadvantge:
less focus on design and documentation since we diliver software very faster.


scrum:
``````
scrum is a framework through whihc we build software product by following 
Agile principles.

Scrum includes group of people called as scrum team.

Normally contains 5 to 9 members.


1)Product Owner

2)Scrum Master

3)Dev Team 

4)QA team


Product owner:
``````````````
Define the features of the product.

Prioritize features according to market value.

Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed

Accept or reject work results.


Scrum Master:
The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process.

and servant-leader responsible for ensuring the scrum team 
adheres to agile principples and follows the scrum framework.
 
 They help remove obstacles, faster collaboration and 
 enable continuious improvement within the team .
 
 
Developers and QA:

  Develop and Test the software

product backlog:
contains list of user stories. prepared by product owner.

sprint/iteration:
period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the product owner 
and team, usually 2-4 weeks of time.

sprint planning meeting:
Metting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint
and duration.

sprint backlog:
List of commited stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

Scrum meeting:
meeting conducted by scrum master everyday 15 mnts. called as 
scrum call /standup meeting.

-what did you do yesterday?
-what will you do today?
-Are there any impediments in your way?


sprint retrospective meeting:


conducts meeting after completion of sprint.
The entire team including both the Scrummaster and the product owner 
should participate.


story point:

Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA 
in the form of fibonacci series.

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13... 

login - dev - 5 qa -3(8hrs)


Burndown chart:
shows how much work remaining in the sprint.
Maintained by the scrum master daily.

A relation/table will be in 1nf if it contains an atomic values.

it states that an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values.
It must hold only single valued attribute.

First normal form disallow the multi valued attributes.

Relation student is not in 1nf because of multivalued attribute languages known.

joins:

innerjoin:
innerjoin returns intersection of rows that satisfy join condition.

if a row in the first table has no matching row in the second table, 
or viceversa, that row will excluded from the resultset.

syntax:

 select col1,col2... from table1 inner join table2 on table1.colname=
 table2.colname;


requirement:

names of the employees along with their department names?

inner join on department_id column (since it is a common column)


select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp inner join dept on 
emp.deptno=dept.deptno;


LEFT JOIN:
LEFT OUTER JOIN
purpose: retrieve all records from left side table
(the table specified before the 'LEFT JOIN' keyword and the matched 
records from the right table.
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns 
from the right table.

syntax:
SELECT col1,col2... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 
ON table1.col=table2.col;

example:
select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from dept left join emp on emp.deptno=dept.deptno;

select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp left join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno;

full join:

select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp left join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno union
select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp right join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno where emp.empno is null

self join:

Subquery:
A subquery in sql is a query nested within another query.

It can be used in various parts of a sql statement, such as 
select from, where, or having clauses. 

subqueries are enclosed in parentheses and can return a single value, 
a single row, a single column or a result set with multiple rows 
and columns.

select col1,col2 from tab1 where 
col3=(select col4 from tab2 where condition);



select col1,col2 from tab1 where 
col3 in(select col4 from tab2 where condition);

coorelated subquery:
select col1,col2 from tab1 t1 where col3>(select avg(col3) from tab1 t2 
where t2.category=t1.category);


1.Retrieve employees who work in the 'IT department'.


select ename from emp where deptno=
(select deptno from dept where dname='RESEARCH');


2.Retrieve employee who work in the RESEARCH or SALES department?

 select ename from emp where deptno in (select deptno from dept where dname in('RESEARCH','SALES')); 

3.Find employees whose salary is above the the average salary
  in their respective departments?
  
  select ename from emp e where sal > 
  (select avg(sal) from emp where deptno=e.deptno));

4.Retrieve department names along with the total no.of employees in each 
  department?
  
  select dname,(select count(*) from emp where deptno=dept.deptno)as num_employees from dept;





select ename from emp where deptno=(select deptno from dept where dname='RESEARCH');
select ename from emp where deptno in (select deptno from dept where dname in('RESEARCH','SALES'));

class is a collection of variables and methods 

how to declare the variables using datatypes .

method:
`````````
method is the place where we are writing the logic. 


[accessmodifier] <returntype> <methodname>([if any parameters])
{

   //logic 
}

void : it is a return type means what it doesn't return any value. 

void sum()
{
System.out.println("sum");
}

void sum(int x, int y)
{
System.out.println(x+y);
}

int getAge()
{
  return 36; 
}
note:return type and return value must be compatible with each other.

int getSum(int x, int y)
{
  return x+y;
}

finally we are keeping these variables and methods inside a class. 
class is a collection of 
   -variables 
   & methods 
   
   
shall we define one class name as Student contains some properties like 
stid,stname,staddress and print their details?


class Student{

 //variables initialization  
  int stid = 100;
  String stname= "anushka";
  String staddress = "bnglr";
  
 //display these details 
 
  public void displayStudentDetails()
  {
     System.out.println("student id is:" + stid);
	 System.out.println("student name is:" + stname);
	 System.out.println("Student address is: " + staddress);

from instance area, if we want to access instance properties how can 
we access?
directly we can access


from any area means either instance area or static area if we want 
to access static properties how can we access?

  using class name or directly or object name
  
from static area if we want to access instance varaibles how can we 
access?

 using object name

	//constructor 
	public Test4()

		//create the object for class 
		Test4 obj= new Test4();
		
		
		//calling display()
		obj.display();
		
	}
	

}


types of constructor:

  1.default constructor -constructor which doesn't takes any parameters
  2.parameterized constructor -constructor which takes parameters 
  
  
  
  
 if you are note defining any constructor(s) in a class, java compiler 
will generate one default constructor automatically  known as 
system defined default constructor .

purpose: it will assign the default values 
for every datatype there is a default value
for the integer category -> 0
for the float category - 0.0
for the character category - single space
for the boolean category - false 

  
example on parameterized constructor;
````````````````````````````````````

public class Test4 {
	//class level variables 
	int x;
	String y;
	
	//parameterized constructor 
    public Test4(int x, String y) {
    	
    	this.x=x;
    	this.y=y;
    }
   
	public void display()
	{
		System.out.println("student id is: " + x);
		System.out.println("student name is : " + y);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//static area
		//create the object for class 
		Test4 obj= new Test4(100,"rk");
		
		
		//calling display()
		obj.display();
		
	}
	

}

can't we define both in a single class?

yes 

try to define both default and parameterized constructor ?


this:
this is the java reserved keyword and we are using in follwing two cases

1.constructor chaining(refer this) and do one program 
2.to differentiate class level varaibles and method level parameters when 
both are same .

we have 4 oops principles 

 inheritance 
 polymorphism 
 abstraction 
 encapsulation 
 

if you really want to compare any objects reference based we should use 
== operator



inheritance:
 
   inheritance is the process of taking the properties from one class 
   to another class. 
   
   usage: reusability 
   
   using extends keyword we can practically implement inheritance. 
   
note:
when we apply the inheritance concept we should create the object 
for child class only not parent class (not recommended)

 
encapsulation:
`````````````
encapsulation is the process of wrapping up of variables and methods 

data hiding 
security 

because to make a class as an encapsulated class, we have to follow 
some rules

   every variable should be declared as private 
   but for every variable we should maintain public setter and getter methods
   
   setter method -> to set the values into an object
   getter method -> to get the values from an object 
   
   
Employee.java:
``````````````
//encapsulated class
public class Employee {
	//private variables
	private int empid;
	private String empname;
	
	//defining public setters and getter methods
	public int getEmpid() {
		return empid;
	}
	public void setEmpid(int empid) {
		this.empid = empid;
	}
	public String getEmpname() {
		return empname;
	}
	public void setEmpname(String empname) {
		this.empname = empname;
	}
	
	
}

Test6.java:
```````````
//execution logic class
public class Test6 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Employee emp = new Employee();
		
		emp.setEmpid(100);
		emp.setEmpname("rk");
		
		System.out.println("employee id is: " + emp.getEmpid());
		System.out.println("employee name is:" + emp.getEmpname());
	}

}

polymorphism:
`````````````````

method overloading:


public class Test7 {
	public void sum(int a, int b)
	{
		System.out.println(a+b);
	}

	public void sum(double a, double b)
	{
		System.out.println(a+b);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Test7 obj = new Test7();
		obj.sum(5, 6);
		obj.sum(6.7,8.9);
			
	}
}

method overriding:
````````````````````
Parent.java:
```````````

public class Parent {

	//overridden method
	public void sum(int x, int y)
	{
		System.out.println("sum is: " +(x+y));
	}
}

Child.java:
``````````

public class Child extends Parent {

	//overriding method
	public void sum(int x, int y) {
		
		System.out.println("sub is: " +(x-y));
	}
	
}

Test8.java:
````````````

public  class Test8 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		/*Child obj = new Child();
		obj.sum(6, 5);*/
		
		/*Parent obj = new Parent();
		obj.sum(6, 5);*/
		//upcasting
		Parent obj = new Child();
		obj.sum(6, 5);
		
		
		
		
	}

}



collection framework :

arrays concept 

->using single variable, we can store multiple values. 
always inside array , data gets stored based on index. 
if size is n, maximum index is n-1

 int x[]={10,20,30};
 x[0]
 x[1]
 x[2]
 
 
 
 in arrays, 
 we have to write the logic manually for every simple operation means 
 arrays don't have any ready made methods
 
 array size is fixed , you can't increae or decrease the size of the array. 
 
 arrays are not folowing proper datastructure. 
 
 arrays supports only homogenious data.
 
 
 collection framework :
 
  interfaces/ classes 
     -java.util package.
	 
	 
 cfw:
    using single variable, we can store multiple values of multiple types 
	also. 
	it supports both homogenious and heterogenous objects
	
	memory size is not fixed, we can increae or decrease at runtime 
	
	cfw contains mostly readymade methods 
	
	cfw follows very good stnadard ds.
	
	
        Collection

 List
           Set
                              Queue
           SortedSet
   
 
adding the object
removing the object .. . 

For the Collection, we don't have any direct implementation class 

for the sub interfaces like List, Set... we have implementation classes.

List
    extends Collection 
	
   ArrayList
   Linkedlist
   
   class ArrayList implements List extends Collection 
   {
   }
   List:
   
    it accepts both homogenious and heterogenous objects
	insertion order is prserved
	null insertion is also possible 
	duplicates are allowed. 
	     
		   ArrayList
		   LinkedList 
		   
	
	Set:
	 it accepts both homogenious and heterogenous objects
	 insertion order we can't predict
	 null insertion is possible but only for one time 
	 duplicates are not allowed. 
	 
	       HashSet
		   LinkedHashSet

public class Test1 {
	
public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	//create the object for ArrayList
	
     List l = new ArrayList();
     l.add(100);
     l.add("rama");
     l.add(100);
     l.add(9.8);
     l.add(null);
     System.out.println(l);
     l.remove(Integer.valueOf(100));
     System.out.println(l);//[rama, 100, 9.8, null]
     l.remove(2);
     System.out.println(l);//[rama, 100, null]
     l.add(0, Integer.valueOf(100));
     System.out.println(l);//[100, rama, 100, null]

     System.out.println(l.size());
     
     System.out.println(l.contains("krishna"));
     
     l.clear();
     System.out.println(l);

     //apply foreach method 
     
     for(Object o:l) {

	   if(i%2==0)
		   System.out.println(i);
   }
}
}


in case of generics what are the benefits

1.we will get compile time errors which are far better than runtime errors 

2.type casting is not required. 

with generics:
``````````````
package com.hexaware.cfw;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Test1 {
	
public static void main(String[] args) {

     List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();
     for(int i=1;i<=10;i++) {
    	 l.add(i);
     }
    
   for(Integer i:l)
   {
	   
	   if(i%2==0)
		   System.out.println(i);
   }
}
}

with generics along with customized objects:

package com.hexaware.cfw;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Test1 {
	
public static void main(String[] args) {

   {
	   
	   if(b.getBookName().startsWith("s"))
		   System.out.println(b.getBookName());
   }
}
}

LinkedList

but the differenece between ArrayList and LinkedList is 

 ->if our frequent operations is modification like insertion/deletion/updation 
 then we will go for LinkedList because internally it is using 
 double linked list algorithm 
 
 ->if our frequent operation is selection /retrieval then we should 
 use ArrayList
 
 
 Set -HashSet,LinkedHashSet
 SortedSet - TreeSet
 Queue -...
 
 
 Map - HashMap,LinkedHashMap
 SortedMap - TreeMap 
 Comparator
 Comparable 
 Set:
 
  it allows both homogenious and heterogenious objects
  duplicates are not allowed
  insertion order is not preserved 
  null insertion is possible but only for one time. 
  
     HashSet
	 LinkedHashSet 
	 
cursors in collections are 

  ->Iterator
  ->ListIterator
  
 example on Iterator:
 package com.hexaware.cfw;

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Set;

public class Test1 {
	
public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	//create the object for Set
	
	
    Set<Integer> s  = new HashSet();
    s.add(34);
    s.add(87);
    s.add(5);
    s.add(675);
    s.add(34);
    
    System.out.println(s);
    
   Iterator<Integer> itr =  s.iterator();
    while(itr.hasNext())
    {
    	Integer i = itr.next();
    	if(i%2==0)
    		itr.remove();
    }
    System.out.println(s);
}
}

in case of LinkedHashSet , insertion order is preserved 
in case of HashSet, we can't predict the order. 

package com.hexaware.cfw;

import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
import java.util.Set;

Comparable - > getting the data in natural sorting order 

Comparator ->
now i want in descending order based on bookid, or i want the data 
based on bookname in reverse order?

Comparator

Comparable is meant for natural sorting order

  java.lang 
  
  compareTo()
  
Comparator is meant for custom order

  java.util 
  compare()
     ->compareTo() 
	 
Map:
Map is the predefined interface available in java.util package 

purpose: to organize the data in the form of (key,value) pair


key ->one object
value -> one object 

 ->HashMap
 ->LinkedHashMap

properties:

1.duplicate key objects are not allowed but duplicate value objects 
  are allowed 
  
2.insertion order is not preserved
3.allows both homogenious and heterogenious objects
4.null insertion is also possible.
  using put(.,.) we can add the key, value objects to the Map object
  
 example:
 package com.hexaware.cfw;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Test2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Map m= new HashMap();
		m.put(100, "rama");
		m.put(101, "hexware");
		m.put(null, null);
		m.put(100, "rk");
		m.put(102, "hexware");
		m.put("techm", 103);
		System.out.println(m);

exception handling:

  exception -> runtime error 
  
  during execution of the program 
  we will get errors because of invalid input. 
  
  enter first no: 100
  enter second no: 0
  java.lang.ArithmeticException: /by zero 
  
  
  ...
  ..  int x = 100/0;
  ...
  ...
  2000 lines of code 

if we get the exception, we havve two drawbacks

1.control terminated abnormally because of that remaining statements 
  will not be executed 
  
2. when we get the exception, end user will get system error messages 
which are not understandable by end user.


we have to handle the exceptions

to handle these exceptions, 
we have 5 java reserved keywords 

1.try
2.catch
3.finally
4.throws
5.throw

try:
using try block we can keep problematic statements 

try{

  //problematic statements
  
}


catch:
it is a block which is used to catch the exception and provides user 
friendly message. 

 syntax: 
      catch(<exceptionclassname> <referencvarname>)
	  {
	    //user friendly message

      }
	  
for a single try block , how many catch blocks we can define?
as many as we want based on the requirement.

but at a time, single catch block gets executed based on the invalid input. 

finally:
`````````
finally block is used to keep the logic which is releated to  release the resources .

->closing related logic 

database connection closing logic 
file closing logic 
etc.. 

we won't get any dataleakage issues

since finally block logic gets exceuted anytime whether your program is 
exception free or not?

jdbc:
jdbc is the technology given by sunmicrosystem 
and implementations are provided by db vendors 

  specification -> it just provides rules and regulations 
  how we can connect with database.
  
  oracle
  mysql
  ingress
  sybase 
  rdbms product 
  in the form of jar files 
  
  interfaces 
  implementation classes are provided by different db vendors 
  
  mysql ->mysqlconnector.jar
  oracle ->ojdbc6.jar
  
  
  purpose: 
    
	  to perform db operatons from java environment 
	  
	  from the db environment
	  
	  using jdbc, we can connect with db from java and we can 
	  perfrom db operations also from java environment. 
	  
steps to follow to write the jdbc program:

1.load the driver class 
in jdbc, we have different types of drivers are there those are varying 
from type1 .. type4 driver. 
mostly people are using type4 driver only for any database. 

   Class.forName("driverclassname");
   
mysql
oracle
 type 4 driver for oracle  ->oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
 type 4 driver for mysql -> com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
 
 we should add orresponding jar file to your buildpath of your project.
 
 package com.hexaware.jdbc;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class Test1 {
public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {
	
	//loading the driver class
	
	Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
    System.out.println("driver class loaded");
    
    
    //get the connection 
    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hexaware", "root", "training@123");
    System.out.println("i got the connection ");
    
    //create the object for Statement 
    Statement st = con.createStatement();
    
    String query = "insert into student values(101,'anushka')";
    
    int x =  st.executeUpdate(query);
  
    System.out.println(x + "row(s) inserted");
    
    //close the connection 
    con.close();
}
}


check for update and delete queries also in the same way 

note:
to process the non select queries we are using executeUpdate() on top 
of Statement object.

to process select queries we are using executeQuery() on top of 
Statement object 

executeUpdate() -return type is integer

executeQuery() - ResultSet 

ResultSet contains different getter methods based on the column type
we have to use those getter methdos 

 column index always starts from 1
 
example for processing select queries:
``````````````````````````````````````

-----------------------
 
 static query is a query that itself contains data is known 
 as static query
  ex: insert into student values(100,'rk');
  
 dynamic query is a query that itself doesn't contains any data 
 ex: insert into student values(?,?);
 ? ->positional parameters 
 
 
 to process the static queries we have to create the object for 
 Statement interface
 
 
 to process the dynamic queries we have to create the object for 
 PreparedStatement interface.
